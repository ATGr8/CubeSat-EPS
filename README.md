# CubeSat-EPS

I am making a design for custom 2U CubeSat EPS, which is simple to implement and is open source. This is because most of the EPS available off the shelf are sold
without much information of the actual circuitry of the board and are very expensive. 

I will be uploading my progress to github as I go - to sorta keep me accountable

The KiCAD Schematic is a litlle rough right now and the file manaegement is not the best, but I will be working on fixing them soon. If you need help with understanding anything feel free to reach out to me
