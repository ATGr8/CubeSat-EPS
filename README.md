# CubeSat-EPS

I am making a design for custom 2U CubeSat EPS, which is simple to implement and is open source. This is because most of the EPS available off the shelf are sold
without much information of the actual cicuitry of the board and are very expensive. 

I will be uploading my progress to github as I go - to sorta keep me accountable
